# Serverless for Frontend Developers tutorial in nodejs

I followed the serverless tut for frontend devs. [fernando-mc](https://github.com/fernando-mc/serverless-learn-serverlessjams) wrote the tut in python, i wrote this in nodejs. 

## Disclaimers 
* This is not pretty in any way. 
* While i've used javascript before, this is the first thing i've written in nodeJS
* I'm trying to get my head around async/sync, so there may be places where this is not done correctly
* There may be places where I've hardcoded a value from auth0, but i can't find it anymore, please let me know if you find it
* The tut is not only adding code to the project, it is also removing some stuff, so there may be places where you can't use this code
* I've not followed the file structure completely, the verify_token og and get_token are both inside the token.js file
* Don't expect it to work EXACTLY as the final product in the tutorial, i have i.e. not tested it with multiple permissions
